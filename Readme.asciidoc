== neoCLASH

link:https://clisp.sourceforge.io/clash.html[CLASH] (CLisp As a SHell) is a 
document describing the steps to turn CLisp into a basic shell on GNU/Linux. +
This repository is based upon this document to provide a modern and handy
LISPy shell experience.

=== Features

==== Running commands

The +#{<command> <args>* }+ form can be used to evaluate shell commands directly in the REPL.

[source,lisp]
----
#{ls --color=always \. }
----

==== Evaluating LISP forms inside commands

In a command, the S-Expression after the +*expansion-start*+ (default: +\#$+) character is evaluated as a LISP form, instead of being turned into a string.

[source,lisp]
----
#{ls $(cd) --color=always }
----

=== Roadmap

* [ ] Pipelines
* [x] LISP code expansion in strings.
* [ ] Job control.

=== Usage

* From a POSIX shell:

[source,bash]
----
$ $([ -z ${PREFIX+x} ] && echo "/usr/" || echo ${PREFIX})/bin/nch
----

=== Installation

Prerequisties: link:https://clisp.sourceforge.io/[+CLISP+].

[source,bash]
----
[PREFIX=/path/(default:/usr)] clisp install.lisp
----
